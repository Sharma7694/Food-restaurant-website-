Developed a voice-activated virtual assistant using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that responds to user commands in real time. Leveraged the browser-native Web Speech API to implement speech recognition and text-to-speech features. The assistant can perform basic tasks such as opening websites (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), reporting the current time and date, and responding to greetings and questions. Features a responsive and interactive UI with custom styling and visual feedback using images and buttons.
